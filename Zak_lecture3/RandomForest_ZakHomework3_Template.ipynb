    "2. Our model will not like feature names that only contain numbers.  To correct for this, you can add a few characters to each of your feature names.  For example, instead of our first feature being called \"7896744\", you can change its title to \"Probe7896744\".  You may find the function paste() useful for this task.\n",
    "3. Train your model using the randomForest() function.  You will need to provide the name of your training data object as the value for the \"data\" paramter.  You will also need to specify the \"formula\" for the model.  In this case, we want the model to use information from all non-Dx columns to predict the value of the Dx column.  You can use the character \".\" to represent \"all non-Dx columns\" in your formula, like:  Dx ~ .\n",
    "4. Print your resulting model object to get basic information about the model you built."
